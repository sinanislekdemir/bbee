Description: # bbee
        Very simple C - C++ Builder
        
        I wrote this little script to help me out with little C or C++ codes.
        
        It basically crawls for sources, compiles and links the objects either to executable binary or to static library. (I love static libraries)
        
        Sometimes I do not want to spend time writing Makefile scripts
        
        thus while sending some sample codes to ppl, I include this.
        
        This has a little convention so as long as you keep the convention, things will be successfully built.
        
        Please note that, I did not wrote this little tiny script for big and complex projects, stick to cmake or autotools if you are planning to write sth complex.
        
        Other than that, this script would do the job for you as well;
        
        ## Quick Start
        Simple run the command below to create an empty C project. This will create an empty directory tree with includes, build and source directory as well as a **capul.json** file already configured. You can create your main.c inside source directory and start by calling *bbee* command to compile and run.
        
            bbee --create
        
        Or run the command below to create an empty C++ project
        
            bbee --create++

        ## How to make install
        
        Creating an installation directive is quite easy, just tell what to copy and where to copy it.
        
        If target directory name starts with ! then it will be created with "mkdir -p" command
        
            # This example will copy build/hello_world to /usr/local/bin
            [
                ["build/hello_world", "/usr/local/bin"]
            ]
        
        
            # This example will try to copy build/hello_world to first directory it can verify
            # if the directory does not exists, it will try the next directory in the list
            [
                ["build/hello_world", ["/usr/local/bin", "/usr/bin"]]
            ]
        
        
            # This will copy the headers include folder to includes and copy the library to libs
            [
                ["./includes", "!/usr/local/includes/mylib"],
                ["build/libmylib.a", ["/usr/local/lib", "/usr/lib"]]
            ]
        
        
        Here is a sample capul.json file
        
            {
                "name": "Hello World",
                "builder": "gcc",
                "sources": [
                    "./src"
                ],
                "includes": [
                    "./include"
                ],
                "libraries": [
                    "pthread"
                ],
                "library_search_paths": [
                    "/usr/local/lib"
                ],
                "frameworks": [
                    "OpenGL",
                    "GLUT"
                ],
                "output": "binary",
                "output_dir": "build",
                "output_name": "hello_world",
                "cflags": "",
                "debug": true,
                "source_extension": ".c",
                "run_after_build": False
            }
        
        Note: just "sources", "output" fields are mandatory, others are optional.
